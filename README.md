# Family Pairing

It is really hard to get the family to sit down and do projects together, but I am trying.  This is a collection of programs that my family has made.  I hope this is not the last update.

Madeline and I sat on the couch on the morning of July 16, 2016, and we worked on this program together.  This was just to kind of give her an understanding of what a program can do.  Emma and Jen joined us later, and we had fun running the program a few times with the family.  Topics covered:

* Variables (answer and name)
* Conditional (was the answer correct)
